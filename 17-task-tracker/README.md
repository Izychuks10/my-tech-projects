# Task Tracker

Create a task tracker with a to-do list using JavaScript.

> This projects will practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating responsive and interactive elements with JavaScript.

Project based on [Task Tracker][task-tracker-js] from [Roadmap Ideas Frontend Projects][roadmap-frontend-projects]

-   **Status**: DONE ðŸŽ‰
-   **Demo**: [here][demo-link] ðŸš€

## Notes

-   This project based on backend projects `task-tracker-cli` I have built previous, please check at [here][be01]. And now I build frontend to help user can interactive with UI not in `cli`.
-   Currently I just use static data `json`, not save in file `json` data like BE01 because I don't want to save file in github pages.

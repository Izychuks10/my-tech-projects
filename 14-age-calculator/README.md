# Age Calculator

Create an age calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app calculates and displays their exact age, including years, and months.

> If you follow by guides of roadmap to use external package in npm, its include 2 packages: Javascript Datepicker and Luxon. But in this project, I challenge myself to research and build a simple my own datepicker and also calculate function by myself.

All tasks I must todo:

-   [x] Using previous project [FE06 - Datepicker UI][fe06-datepcicker-ui] I have done with UI, and now just begin build function for show up the calendar by Javascript.
-   [x] Research caculates age, years and months for display the results.

Project based on [Age Calculator][age-calculator] from [Roadmap Ideas Frontend Projects][roadmap-frontend-projects]

-   **Status**: DONE ðŸŽ‰
-   **Demo**: [here][demo-link] ðŸš€

## Notes

Current calendar not really completed, just a basic calendar. I am thinking to impove for more featureds like:

-   [ ] Can pick years and months when click the title calendar. Like some packages calendar: bootstrap or JS Datepicker etc...
-   [ ] Format the date

Will create and updates ASAP!!! :wink:

# Age Calculator

Create an age calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app calculates and displays their exact age, including years, and months.

> If you follow by guides of roadmap is use external package in npm, its include 2 packages: Javascript Datepicker and Luxon. But in this project, I have my own challenge is build a simple my own datepicker and also calculate function by my self research.

All tasks I must todo:

-   [] Using previous project [FE06 - Datepicker UI][fe06-datepcicker-ui] I have done with UI, and now just begin build function for show up the calendar by Javascript.
-   [] Research caculates age, years and months for display the results.

Project based on [Age Calcularot][age-calculator] from [Roadmap Ideas Frontend Projects][roadmap-frontend-projects]
